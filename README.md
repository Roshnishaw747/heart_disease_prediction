ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning (ML)

This project is about predicting whether a person has heart disease based on some common health details. We used machine learning to make this prediction, with the goal of helping in early detection and awareness.

#  What This Project Includes

- Cleaned the dataset to remove extra spaces and prepare it for use
- Created visual charts to understand the data better (like pie, bar, and line charts)
- Trained a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict heart disease
- Checked how accurate the model is
- Saved all charts and results for future reference or reports

#  Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the most serious health problems today. The idea behind this project is to use data science to predict heart disease using patient information like age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and more. 

We started by cleaning the dataset (heart.csv), removed any unnecessary spaces, and converted text labels to numbers. After that, we explored the data visually using:

- ðŸ”´ *Pie chart* â€“ to see how many people had heart disease
- ðŸ“Š *Bar chart* â€“ to compare age with disease presence
- ðŸ“ˆ *Line chart* â€“ to show trends in age and heart disease

Once we understood the data, we trained a Random Forest Classifier â€” a popular and reliable machine learning model. It performed well and gave accurate results.
